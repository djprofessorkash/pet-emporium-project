# Pet Emporium

This is a tutorial project build intended for graduates of both the SE and DS tracks at Flatiron School.

The intention is to introduce basic data science and machine learning development to software engineering graduates while also introducing software engineering techniques to data science graduates.

The goal is to construct a more evolved and product-oriented project prototype to help progress graduate portfolios.
